LAB
This lab is designed to have the engineer verify and execute their automation tools to interact with the
OS in a controlled fashion.
If you do the killercoda Lab 2, just answer these questions. If you are doing the lab in the ProLUG
environment, find the scripts in /labs/automation/unit2.

Lab Setup (ProLUG Lab Only):
```
1. cp -r /labs/automation/unit2/* /root
2. chmod 755 *.sh
3. chmor 755 *.py
```
Bash execution:
1. Run the u2_script1.sh and look at what it shows you.
a. /root/u2_script1.sh
What are you shown?
2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first 15 lines.
a. cat /root/u2_script1.sh
Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.
```
# This script displays the first and last 10 lines of the /etc/passwd file  with open("/etc/passwd", "r") as f:                                             
    lines = f.readlines()                                                       
    print("".join(lines[:15]))                                                  
    print("...")                                                                
    print("".join(lines[-15:]))                                                                                                                         
#This script displays just the last 10 lines of the /etc/passwd file        
with open("/etc/passwd", "r") as f:                                             
    lines = f.readlines()                                                       
    print("".join(lines[-15:]))

3. Run the u2_script2.sh and look at what it shows you.
    a. /root/u2_script2.sh
What happened in the script? Did it work correctly?
    b. ls -l /root
4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it use a different date format. You may have to read the
man pages for date command.
    a. cat /root/u2_script2.sh

As you’re interacting with the OS, are there any observations you have about how the scripts are set up,
their structure and their output. Is there anything you would add for your scripts? If you would add
something, how does it improve the code?

Python execution:
1. Run the u2_script1.py and look at what it shows you.
    a. /root/u2_script1.py
What are you shown?
```
root,node_exporter
```
2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first and last 15 lines.
    a. cat /root/u2_script1.py
Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.
3. Run the u2_script2.py and look at what it shows you.
    a. /root/u2_script2.py
What are you shown?
4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it use a different user shell, maybe one you've seen from
other output in this lab.
    a. cat /root/u2_script2.py
Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.

Ansible execution:
1. Run the u2_script1.yml and look at what it shows you.
    a. ansible-playbook /root/u2_script1.yml
What are you shown?
2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first and last 15 lines.
    a. cat /root/u2_script1.yml
Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.
3. Run the u2_script2.yml and look at what it shows you.
    a. ansible-playbook /root/u2_script2.yml
What are you shown?
4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it name the file differently or populate different content.
    a. cat /root/u2_script2.yml
Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.
```
Modified yml file to craft the script differently.

5. Do one final ls -l against the /root directory. What is a difference between the .sh .py and .yml
files?
    a. ls -l
```
The .yml files don't need x(execute) permissions to run like the bash and python scripts
```
